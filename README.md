# Subgroup 1 + soubgroup 3 + subgroup 4
this branch is for merging subgroup 1 code with 3 and 4
Both subgroup 1 and 3's HTTP requests work together when running server.js now.
servertemp.js is just subgroup 3. database.js is subgroup 1 code. I have kept both here just in case.


subgroup 3 code is compatible but we need to make it so it interacts with the product and member databases and whatever else it needs to.

subgroup 4 code still needs to be made compatible
